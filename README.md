## Description

With so many client-side frameworks these days, it can be tough to figure out which one to start with. Vue.js is the perfect gateway framework for taking the first step into the constantly changing client-side framework ecosystem.

Join me for a hands-on deep dive into Vue.js. You’ll start from a bare-bones HTML5 template and build three applications from the ground up. Along the way, you’ll explore Vue.js key concepts and learn how it compares to other frameworks like Angular and React.

Topics include:

- Vue.js overview
- How Vue.js compares to frameworks like React and Angular
- Why you should use it
- Vue.js essential concepts
- Getting started

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
